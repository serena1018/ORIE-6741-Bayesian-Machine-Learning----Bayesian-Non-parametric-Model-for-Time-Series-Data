## Abstract
We propose a novel Bayesian non-parametric
framework for time-series data modeling with
pattern discovery and online inference. We experiment
with using the Indian Buffet Process
and the infinite Hidden Markov Model for automatic
pattern or cluster discovery. Our model
then uses a novel framework for online inference
of the time-series data using Gaussian Process regression
with a Spectral Mixture kernel function
and hypothesis testing. We consider the scalability
of the model during online inference due
to evaluation of the clusters rather than the entire
dataset.
